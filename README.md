## Cloud Resume Project â€“ frontend

The project highlights my proficiency in cloud computing, showcasing the various AWS tools I utilized to deploy a static website (my resume).
This repository exclusively contains the front-end code of my Cloud Resume Website, streamlined for straightforward deployment.
